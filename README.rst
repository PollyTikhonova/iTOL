`iTOL` provides a Python API and a command-line tool for the Tree of Life (`iTOL <http://iTOL.embl.de>`_).

This API is intentionally designed for interacting with iTOL server. The author suggests use this
API to handle big datasets or programmatically manipulated phylogenetic trees and associated
annotation datasets. The API allows users interact with iTOL server using Python or shell. In order
to visualize your data, an active internet connection to iTO server is required.
